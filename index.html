        <h1>Introduction to the body mass index (BMI)
        </h1>
        <p> Body Mass Index (BMI) is widely used as an indicator of body fat content. Your weight alone is not
            sufficient to establish if you are in a healthy weight range. For example, a tall but slender person can
            weigh more than a short but plump individual. But the former may enjoy better health as long as their weight
            is suitable for their height. The ideal weight is also likely to differ for men and women of similar
            heights.

            How then do you know whether you fall in the healthy weight range or not? Your BMI solves this confusion. It
            correlates your weight with your height and evaluates whether your weight is appropriate for your stature.
            You can use a BMI calculator to find out your BMI.

            Although not an exact measurement of body fat percentage, in most cases, BMI is a reliable tool for
            establishing risk levels for illnesses, especially ailments related to excess body fat. Many healthcare
            professionals use BMI to determine effective doses for medicines. Often people with a higher BMI need higher
            doses. Hence, it is crucial to be aware of your BMI to ensure your overall wellness.</p>
        <h1> How to calculate BMI</h1>
        <p>If you want to calculate your BMI, you have to find out your weight and height first. Once you know these
            values, you can arrive at the result by following the two steps mentioned below:</p><br>
        <p class="box">1. Multiply your height by itself (height X height). <br>
            <br>
            2.Divide your weight by the answer you get in the first step
